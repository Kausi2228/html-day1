                Karna (Sanskrit: कर्ण, IAST: Karṇa), also known as Vasusena, Anga-raja,
                 and Radheya,[2] is one of the main protagonists of the Hindu epic Mahābhārata.
                 [3][4] He is the son of the sun god Surya and princess Kunti 
                 (mother of the Pandavas), and thus a demigod of royal birth. 
                 Kunti was granted the boon to bear a child with desired divine qualities
                  from the gods and without much knowledge, Kunti invoked the sun god to
                   confirm it if it was true indeed. Karna was secretly born to an unmarried
                    Kunti in her teenage years, and fearing outrage and backlash from society 
                    over her premarital pregnancy, Kunti had no choice but to abandon the newly 
                    born Karna adrift in a basket on the Ganges, in the hope that he finds foster 
                    parents.[3][5] The basket is discovered, and Karna is adopted and raised by 
                    foster Sūta parents named Radha and Adhiratha Nandana[2] of the charioteer and
                     poet profession working for king Dhritarashtra.[3]
